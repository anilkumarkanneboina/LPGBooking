    <string-array name="Answers">
        <item>\nThis app supports phone booking for any LPG provider for which you can get a refill booking number. But, SMS booking can only be done for following three providers - Indane(by Indian Oil Corporation), Bharath Gas(by Bharath Petroleum
        Corporation Ltd),HP Gas(by Hindusthan Petroleum Corporation Ltd).</item>
        <item>\nWe can help you with atleast for three among the major players.\n<a href="https://myhpgas.in/myHPGas/HPGas/OtherDistributorInformation.aspx">HP Gas</a>\n

            You need to register your mobile number with LPG provider. This is a pre-requisite to refill using Phone / SMS option.
        </item>
        <item>\nAlmost all LPG providers require a registration of phone number with which SMS / Phone booking can be done. This is a process by which your LPG provider would identify
            your LPG connection by mapping it to your mobile number, and hence, LPG provider is able to book re-fill to
            correct customer subsequently.  So, before you effectively use booking features in this app,
        you need to register your phone number. Please read on to understand how to register your phone no.</item>
        <item>
            Registration of your mobile number with your LPG provider is nothing but associating your preferred mobile number to your connection. This is necessary for
            your service provider to identify your connection correctly during subsequent booking.
        </item>

        <item>Please visit options under menu in home screen. You will find detailed documentation about phone registration, with
        major three providers in links below.

        </item>
        <item>For us to confirm if your SMS booking has been successful, we would need to read your SMS-es. It becomes difficult to
            confirm success or failure based on SMS for us. Hence, we do start tracking your refill connection even after successful processing
            of SMS. If your are doing SMS booking, please manually enter your refill book date against your connection in Home page.
